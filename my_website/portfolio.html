       <h2><u> What is Scratch? </u></h2>
           <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is a programming language and an online community
       where children can program and share interactive media such as
       stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world. 
       As children create with Scratch, they learn to think creatively, work 
       collaboratively, and reason systematically</p>

       <h2><u>Python??</u></h2>
           <p><a href="https://repl.it/ECP6/6">Python</a> is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its 
           high-level built in data structures, combined with  dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive 
           for Rapid Application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
           together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces  the cost of program maintenance.
           Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p>

       <h2><u>NEVER heard of Arduino?</h2></u>
           <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is an open-source computer hardware and software company,
       project and user community that designs and manufactures microcontroller-based 
       kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and 
       control objects in the physical world.</p>

       <h2><u> What about the Weather Balloon? </u></h2>
           <p>A weather balloon is a balloon which carries instruments aloft to
       send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind
       speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. These 
       are pictures from the day my class launched this project dated 9, December 2016.
       We had 2 failed attempts but we achived it on our 3rd try as we removed some stuff.</p>

       <h2><u> NetLogo? </u></h2>
           <p><a href="http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Art/Unverified/Geometron%20Top-Down.nlogo">NetLogo</a> is is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. 
        It is used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and researchers 
        worldwide. Cool isn't it?</p>
